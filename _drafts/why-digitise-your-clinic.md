# Why digitise your clinic?

Digitisation is the process of converting from a physical format into a digital one.

Imagine having the ability of going through your patient's medical history by simply searching for their name rather than looking through a filing cabinet. These are the promises offered by the Digital Age.

#### Security

Having medical records kept in files and storage units in your clinic is extremely likely to be stolen, misplaced, or simply becoming lost. Is your clinic immune to fire, or any other natural disasters?

Having sensitive information about your patients stored in highly secure computer servers, in multiple regions, across continents with regular backups and instant access is certainly a no brainer.
