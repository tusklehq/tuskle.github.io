# Why digitise your clinic?

Digitisation is the process of converting from a physical format into a digital one.

Imagine having the ability of going through your patient's medical history by simply searching for their name rather than looking through a filing cabinet. Letting other practitioner or members of staffs in your clinic have the same level of access or even a restricted one to the same information can open up endless possibilities for the way a clinic is run. And even improve the way medical professionals diagnose which in turn helps the patient get better care. These are the promises offered by the Digital Age.

#### The Digital Age

#### Security

Having medical records kept in files and storage units in your clinic is extremely likely to be stolen, misplaced, or simply becoming lost. Is your clinic immune to fire, or any other natural disasters?

Having sensitive information about your patients stored in highly secure computer servers, in multiple regions, across continents with regular backups and instant access is certainly a no brainer.

#### Analytics

#### Benefits

Eliminate the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is accurate and legible.

#### Tools of Trade

The answer to the question of whether to use the power of the web, and digitalisation to empower the medical professionals is an obvious one by now. However, the landscape of tools available today are limited or extremely complicated for mere mortals. Most of the applications available feels like they are just trying to replicate Microsoft Excel on the Web. Others, require you to have technical knowledge including install software, maintaining them and occasionally debugging these applications. 

The few that are usable are tuned and priced for big medical enterprises and is not affordable for the majority of clinics.
